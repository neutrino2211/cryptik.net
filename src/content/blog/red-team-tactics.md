# Red Team Operations: Simulating Real-World Attacks

A red team exercise goes beyond traditional penetration testing. It's a comprehensive assessment that simulates how real threat actors would target your organization, testing not just technical controls but also people and processes.

## What Makes Red Teaming Different?

Unlike traditional penetration tests with defined scopes, red team operations:
- Use adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- Target the entire organization, not just IT systems
- Operate with minimal disclosure to test real-world detection
- Include social engineering and physical security testing

## Our Red Team Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
We gather intelligence just as threat actors would:
- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Network enumeration
- Social media reconnaissance
- Physical surveillance (with authorization)

### Phase 2: Initial Access
Multiple vectors are tested:
- Phishing campaigns
- Exploitation of public-facing applications
- Physical intrusion attempts
- Supply chain compromise scenarios

### Phase 3: Lateral Movement
Once inside, we test detection capabilities:
- Moving across network segments
- Privilege escalation
- Credential harvesting
- Persistence mechanisms

### Phase 4: Objective Achievement
We attempt to reach defined objectives:
- Data exfiltration
- System compromise
- Access to critical assets
- Administrative control

## Lessons from Recent Engagements

In a recent red team exercise for a Nigerian tech company, we:
- Gained initial access through a targeted phishing campaign
- Moved laterally through the network undetected for 48 hours
- Accessed sensitive customer data
- Maintained persistence for the duration of the engagement

The organization's blue team eventually detected our activities, but the exercise revealed critical gaps in:
- Email security controls
- Network segmentation
- Security monitoring
- Incident response procedures

## Building a Stronger Defense

The value of red teaming isn't just in identifying vulnerabilities—it's in:
- Testing detection and response capabilities
- Training blue teams with real scenarios
- Validating security investments
- Building a security-aware culture

## Getting Started

Red team operations require careful planning and clear rules of engagement. If you're considering a red team assessment for your organization, contact us to discuss how we can help strengthen your security posture.
